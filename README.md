### Hello fellow Godot gamers and game devs!!

I am not a programmer by profession althought I have programmed in some languages over the years out of necessity.  I found Godot to be a powerful game engine with a lot to offer the aspiring game tinkerer.  I started with the goal of creating a fun but educational 2D RPG for my children to play.  That goal remains but found I need to complete a few smaller projects to hone my skills - like so many great Godot developers have recommended.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a 2D platformer titled Submarine Rescue.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Godot game development principles.  I started lofty 2D pixel art RPG style in the genre of Legend of Zelda but quickly became overwhelmed with complexities.  So I paused development on that to complete my platformer.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Godot 2D game development.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: The best way to reach me are in the Godot Forums https://godotforums.org/profile/joedad and here on GitHub.
- Some key features in my current portfolio of experience (if I can call it that!):
    - Custom GUI features (trim bubble indicator, custom gage meters)
    - Customized hose design using a modified version of the rigid body 2D chain code
    - Unique hose reel system which keeps tension on the hose during game play
    - 2D Platformer game uses prebuilt ocean floors and randomly selects the floors and places for each game play session
    - 2D submarine rescue platformer uses Area2D/Collision shapes to apply ocean current forces to various bodies in play
