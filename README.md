### Hello fellow Godot gamers and game devs!!
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a 2D platformer titled Submarine Rescue.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Godot game development principles.  I started lofty 2D pixel art RPG style in the genre of Legend of Zelda but quickly became overwhelmed with complexities.  So I paused development on that to complete my platformer.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Godot 2D game development.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: The best way to reach me are in the Godot Forums https://godotforums.org/profile/joedad and here on GitHub.
